# Optical-Flow
Implementation of Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm for detecting and tracking moving objects in a video

Lucas Kanade algorithm has been performed on images of the Middlebury dataset to find the optical flow between two image frames.
This has also been experimented on videos for tracking and obtaining segmentation masks of moving objects. 

This was done as a part of Computer Vision course Spring 2020
